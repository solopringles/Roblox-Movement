# 🚀 Movement Archetypes System

Yo team! This is the movement system for our game. It's built to be modular, fast, and easy to expand. No more spaghetti code for every new ability.

## 🛠 How it Works
The system is **data-driven**. Every class is just a table in a `ModuleScript`. 

- **`MovementService` (Server)**: The brain. It handles the actual physics and cooldowns so people can't cheat.
- **`MovementController` (Client)**: Listens for Q/E inputs and tells the server to fire an ability.
- **`MovementUtil` (Shared)**: A bunch of math and physics helpers (Knockback, Raycasting, etc).

## 🃏 Classes & Rarities
We have 21 classes across 4 tiers: **Common, Rare, Legendary, and Mythic**.
Each class script in `src/Shared/Classes` follows this structure:
- **Passives**: Stat buffs (Speed/Jump) or mechanic flags.
- **Active 1 (Q)**: Your primary mobility/utility move.
- **Active 2 (E)**: Usually your secondary utility or offensive move.

## ➕ Adding a New Class
1. Create a new `ModuleScript` in `src/Shared/Classes`.
2. Copy the template from `QuickStep.lua`.
3. Give it a name, tier, and define the `Active1`/`Active2` logic.
4. The `MovementService` will automatically pick it up—no need to edit the service script!

## ⚠️ Things to Know (Dev Notes)
- **Physics**: We use `LinearVelocity` for smooth dashes and `Explosion` blasts (set to 0 damage) for area-of-effect knockback.
- **Cooldowns**: CDs are enforced on the **Server** with tier-based minimum cooldowns, so stronger classes can't spam as hard.
- **Targeting**: Cursor-aimed abilities send the mouse hit position, but the server clamps that target so clients can't aim arbitrarily far away.
- **Wall Kicks**: Some classes (like Accelerator) check for walls. If you find them being wonky, check the `RaycastParams` in `MovementUtil`.
- **Scaling**: For Gear 5 or other size-changing moves, use `character:ScaleTo()` and avoid mutating read-only physics properties directly.

## 🔌 How to Load into Roblox Studio

You have two ways to get this code into your game:

### Option A: Using Rojo (Recommended)
This is the "pro" way. It keeps your code on your computer and syncs it automatically to Studio.
1. Install the **Rojo** plugin in Roblox Studio and the **Rojo** extension in VS Code.
2. In VS Code, press `F1` and run `Rojo: Serve`.
3. In Roblox Studio, open the Rojo plugin and click **Connect**.
4. The system will automatically build itself in `ReplicatedStorage`, `ServerScriptService`, and `StarterPlayerScripts`.

### Option B: Manual (The Old Fashioned way)
If you don't want to use Rojo, just copy-paste:
1. **Shared**: Create a Folder in `ReplicatedStorage` named `MovementSystem`. Copy everything from `src/Shared` into it as `ModuleScripts`.
2. **Server**: Create a Folder in `ServerScriptService` named `MovementSystem`. Copy `src/Server/MovementService.lua` into it as a `Script`.
3. **Client**: Create a Folder in `StarterPlayer/StarterPlayerScripts` named `MovementSystem`. Copy `src/Client/MovementController.lua` into it as a `LocalScript`.

## 🔗 GitHub
Since we're using Git, remember to pull before you start working so you don't get merge conflicts on the class files.
